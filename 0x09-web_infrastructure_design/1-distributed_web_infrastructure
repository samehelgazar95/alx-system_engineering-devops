**You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:**
[1] For every additional element, why you are adding it:

- Added Additional Server and Load Balancer:
  The new configuration has one more master server to load, and both are working
  together based on the active-active setup, and the load will be distributed between
  them using the additional load balancer

[2] What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works?:

- Algo of load balance: It's algo of the load balancer is round-robin algo, which means the queries requested will be distributed sequentially through the two master server one after another.

[3] Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both?:

- The load-balancer is enabling active-active setup.
- Active-Active cluster:
  means that both servers are active at the same time, and both
  of them are receiving the same number of queries sequentially one after another,
  in order to prevent the overload.
- Active-Passive cluster:
  means there is an primary active server and another secondary standby server,
  the primary one is receiving all the requests from the load balancer,
  until something bad happen to it, then the load balancer switches the
  requests to the passive server, and keeps receive requests until the primary
  one is going back to life, and then the load balancer switches back the queries
  to the primary one.
  there's a monitor that monitoring the status of the both servers and send status
  to the load balancer, and to the servers themselves.

[4] How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works?:

- .......

[5] the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application?:

- ........

**You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:**
[1] Where are SPOF:

- There is an SPOF at the load balancer, as if it fails the whole system will fail

[2] Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS):

- No firewall so the system design is not secure and hacker can easily access the server.
- No HTTPS: as the design does not contain SSL, so there is no an https protocols,
  and the text won't be encrypted.

[3] No Monitoring:

- as there is no any monitors in the server, so the load balancer or
  other server would not know if there is a server down or not, and the load balancer could keep sending requests to a down server which will cause a problem and responses to fail.
