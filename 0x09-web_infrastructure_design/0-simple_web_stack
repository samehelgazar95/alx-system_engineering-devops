**You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:**
[1] What is a server?:

- Server is computer (virtual or physical) that contains the code files and
  the data and serves the application or the web page.
- it's usually located in datacenters and is accessible through the internet
  and runs OS (usually: Linux).

[2] What is the role of the domain name?:

- The role of the domain name is to identify the websites and other internet
  resources with a text based label than the numerical protocols, which make
  it easier for human to memorize it.

[3] What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com?:

- DNS record is A Record

[4] What is the role of the web server?:

- Web server is responsible for hosting the static content and responding via HTML.
- Use only HTTP & HTTPS protocols

[5] What is the role of the application server?:

- Application server is responsible for hosting the static and dynamic content.
- Use several protocols, including HTTP & HTTPS protocols

[6] What is the role of the database?:

- DataBase role is and flexible way to store date for easy retrieving and manipulation.

[7] What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?:

- Web server through the HTTP or HTTPS.

**You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:**

- SPOF:
  there is an SPOF at the server, as there is only one server handling the requests
  and without any load balancers or firewalls or any backup servers, so it's easy
  for the sever to burn out, and be out of service
  Also another one SPOF at the DB, as there is only one DB, so if it's down,
  the whole system will be down.

- Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server
  needs to be restarted):
  as there is only one server, so there will be a great issue when deploying a new code,
  as we have to restart the whole server or maybe shutting down the server until finishing
  updating the code, which will cause a very low level of availability.

- Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic:
  Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic because there is only one server handling
  handling everything alone, so if the traffic is much more than this server can afford,
  it will burn out and maybe be stop providing any services.
