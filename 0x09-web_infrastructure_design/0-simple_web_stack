**about this infrastructure:**
[1]

- Server is computer (virtual or physical) that contains the code files and
  the data and serves the application or the web page.
- it's usually located in datacenters and is accessible through the internet
  and runs OS (usually: Linux).

[2]

- The role of the domain name is to identify the websites and other internet
  resources with a text based label than the numerical protocols, which make
  it easier for human to memorize it.

[3]

- A Record

[4]

- Web server is responsible for hosting the static content and responding via HTML.
- Use only HTTP & HTTPS protocols
-

[5]

- Application server is responsible for hosting the static and dynamic content.
- Use several protocols, including HTTP & HTTPS protocols

[6]

- DataBase role is and flexible way to store date for easy retrieving and manipulation.

[7]

- Web server through the HTTP or HTTPS.

**the issues are with this infrastructure:**

- SPOF:
  there is an SPOF at the server, as there is only one server handling the requests
  and without any load balancers or firewalls or any backup servers, so it's easy
  for the sever to burn out, and be out of service

- Downtime when maintenance needed:
  as there is only one server, so there will be a great issue when deploying a new code,
  as we have to restart the whole server or maybe shutting down the server until finishing
  updating the code, which will cause a very low level of availability.

- Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic because there is only one server handling
  handling everything alone, so if the traffic is much more than this server can afford,
  it will burn out and maybe be stop providing any services.
