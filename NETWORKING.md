- What happen when you enter google.com, Is kinda looks like what happen when you decide to buy cloths from a cloths shop.

- in the internet world there are clients and servers, the client is any device (Computer, Mobile ...) is connecting to the internet [In our world , it's the customer who buy cloth], and the server is simply a computer that hosts the websites assets and files you visit [Is like the cloths shop that displays clothes].

- And in order to go to the clothes shop, you need first to know the address of that shop, and the same happens in the internet, when ever you wanna display a specific website you need first to know the address of this website , and it's called IP Address, every websites has it's own IP address.

- and as in our world we are saving the places addresses in a map or addresses books or maybe you already memorize it, in the internet there are something like this called DNS (Domain Name Server) it's like the addresses book, that contains all websites' addresses. and the client can memorize the IP address too, maybe in the browser cache or the Operating system cache, so we the browser or the client searches there first if not found it will ask the DNS to reply with the IP address.

- Oh i forgot to to tell you that we call google.com as domain name so for facebook.com, alibaba.com etc, this thing is called Domain Name is like Clothes Shop Adidas, Nike, Puma an so on.

- now we got the the address of the domain name and the clothes shop. whenever you decide to go to clothes shop, you have to think about the transportation, and to take care of the road (look left and right) and be secure, and the same is happening in the internet world, In order to the client go to the server and download the content of the websites (Like buying clothes from the clothes shop), the client need to have a secure road and it's called TCP/IP (Transport Control Protocol, Internet Protocol), this is the secure transportation for the client to go to the server, and we have extra securing tools too like Firewall and this makes us more secure.

- Now we are the clothes shop (The server), In order ro make a conversation you and the salesperson need to agree for a language to communicate (English, Russian or Arabic), the same thing in the internet, we have create some languages for the client and the server to communicate and it's called HTTP, HTTPS, SFTP SMTP ... and based on which server we are visiting, we will use the appropriate language. (HTTPS is the secured version of HTTP and it stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol and this is the most used one in the internet).

- and whenever you buy a clothes you be happy but if not buying any you maybe be sad, the same in the internet, when ever the client browse the websites successfully, the server sends back "200 OK" Message that means every thing was okay, but maybe some errors happen in this trip and based on the error, the client will receive an error message.aq
